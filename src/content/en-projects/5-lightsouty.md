Classic puzzle game "Lights Out," with a 3x3 layout and unlimited moves. The game is played by pressing the squares on the game board, which toggles the lights on and off. The objective of the game is to turn off all the lights on the board. As each square is pressed, the adjacent squares also toggle their state, adding to the challenge of the game.
