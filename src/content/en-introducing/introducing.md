I'm a recent graduate in Systems Engineering from Tecnol√≥gico Mario Molina. I'm passionate about front-end web development, with experience using Typescript, Javascript, React, NextJS and Astro.

I've built a CMS-enabled website for Keto Bakery & Coffee. I'm currently seeking opportunities to join a development team and further develop my skills.
