I'm a recent graduate in Systems Engineering from Tecnol√≥gico Mario Molina. I'm passionate about front-end web development, with experience using Typescript, Javascript, React, NextJS and Astro. I've built a CMS-enabled website for Keto Bakery & Coffee and contributed to a teacher planning system's front-end. I'm currently seeking opportunities to join a development team and further develop my skills.
